## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The code with implement a game of tic tac toe. The same rules apply as the real life game. Each player selects a spot and tries to stop the other from winning. Once the game is complete you can have the option to start another game if you'd like. It's nothing to spectacular, just around my current skill level on what I could accomplish.

Not really any new skills will be required as we have gone over most of the necessry steps to complete this. I think.
